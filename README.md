# Horiseon Social Solution Website Maintenance

# Purpose

Horiseon has an already deployed application whose code needs to be more organized, accessable, and have a reusable format without altering the layout of the page. The purpose of this project is to refactor the already established code to make the web application more accessible and organized. To meet these standards, please see the "Changes" section of this file.

# Changes

In order to meet Horiseon's Acceptance Criteria, I completed the following steps:

1. I replaced div elements with more specific elements that is specific to the contents of the application page. For example, I replaced div with elements such as header, nav, main, aside, footer, etc. This will help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of this web page.

2. On the style sheet, I consolidated the CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow semantic structure.

3. CSS and HTML files are properly commented.

4. I added alt attributes to appropriate image elements.

5. I organized the heading attributes so that they fall in sequential order.

6. Wrote a concise and descriptive title (Horiseon Social Solution Services).

7. Made sure all links function propertly in the navigation in the header by adding id's which allows a "click" to go directly to that section.

8. Updated CSS selectors in stylesheet to properly correspond with HTML classes and id.
