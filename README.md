# Horiseon Social Solution Website Maintenance

## Purpose

Horiseon has an already deployed application whose code is unorganized and unaccessable. There are many unneccasary div elements as well as un organized element structure. Horiseon wants their code to be refactored without altering the layout of the page. The purpose of this project is to refactor the already established code to make the web application more accessible and organized. To meet these standards, please see the "Changes" section of this file.

## Changes

In order to meet Horiseon's Acceptance Criteria, I completed the following steps:

1. I replaced div elements with more specific elements that is specific to the contents of the application page. For example, I replaced div with elements such as header, nav, main, aside, footer, and article. This will help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of this web page.

2. On the style sheet, I consolidated the CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow semantic structure.

3. Added comments in the different sections of the HTML and CSS files so that readers have a good understanding of what section each code pertains to.

4. Added alt attributes to appropriate image elements.

5. Organized the heading attributes so that they fall in sequential order.

6. Gave the website a title in the head section that is descriptive (Horiseon Social Solution Services).

7. Made sure all links in the html function propertly by linking the corresponding anchor elements in the "Navigation starts" section to the id's in the "Contents start" section. Now, when a user clicks on the content in the navigation located in the head of this application, it will go directly to that section.

8. Updated CSS selectors in stylesheet to properly correspond with HTML classes and id.
