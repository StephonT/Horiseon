# Horiseon Website Maintenance Page

I was asked by the company, Horiseon, to refactor code for their website. Horiseon wanted codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

# Horiseon's Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards <br />
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Refactoring Code

In order to meet Horiseon's Acceptance Criteria, I completed the following steps:

1. Added semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer. This will help the search engines and other user devices to determine the importance and context of web pages.

2. On the style sheet, I consolidated the CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow semantic structure.

3. CSS and HTML files are properly commented.

4. I added alt attributes to necessary image elements.

5. I organized the heading attributes so that they fall in sequential order.

6. Wrote a concise and descriptive title.

7. Made sure all links function propertly in the navigation in the header by adding id's which allows a "click" to go directly to that section.
